# webshop
a web shop written in asp.net mvc using entity framework, bootstrap, angular and c#

This project was created to practice the used technologies.

# use this project yourself 
I used a local SQL server so for you to use this project you have too find and replace the relevant connection settings.
When this project runs it will create the database when needed, during the creation a few products are added to the initial database to show the layout of the site. A user with admin rights is also created during initialization.
